Title: Getting and Cleaning Data Project for Week 4 Project
Author Choong-Hoon Hyun

# The run_analysis.R script is written with the following five steps. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# package used for this project is "dplyr".

# Step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  ## 1.1  The dataset is downaloded and extracted in the folder named UCI HAR Dataset.
  ## 1.2  Load data activity Labels and Features:
      ### features <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt", col.names = c("n", "functions"))
          : The "features" selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
      ### activities <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt", col.names = c("code", "activity"))
          : This has labels of each activity. The activities will be used to label name columns of "TidyData"
  ## 1.3  Load test data-sets:
      ###  subject_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt", col.names = "subject")
           : Load the volunteer test subjects being observed. 
      ###  x_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt", col.names = features$functions)
           : This has the recorded test data. 
      ###  y_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/Y_test.txt", col.names = "code")
           : It has the activity codes associated with x_test
  ## 1.4 Load train data-sets
      ###  subject_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt", col.names = "subject")
           : Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
      ###  x_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt", col.names = features$functions)
           : It has recorded training dataset. 
      ###  y_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/Y_train.txt", col.names = "code")
           : t has the activity codes associated with x_train        
  ## 1.5 Create one data set.
      ###  X <- rbind(x_train, x_test): X is made by merging x_train and x_test with rbind() function 
      ###  Y <- rbind(y_train, y_test): Y is created by merging y_train and y_test with rbind() function 
      ###  Subject <- rbind(subject_train, subject_test): Subject is made by merging subject_train and subject_test with rbind() function
      ###  Merged_dataset <- cbind(Subject, Y, X): This will create one merged dataset to make a tidy dataset. 

# Step 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  ## TidyData <- Merged_dataset %>% select(subject, code, contains("mean"), contains("std")): This dataset is made by subsetting Merged_dataset.
     We only need "subject", "code", and "mean" and "standard deviation" for each measurement.

# Step 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  ## TidyData$code <- activities[TidyData$code, 2]: The code in TidyData is replaced by corresponding names of each activity on activities

# Step 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  ## names(TidyData)[2] = "activity": This Changes the name of the 2nd column from "code" to "activity".
  ## names(TidyData) <- gsub("Acc", "Accelerometer", names(TidyData)): This replaces all "acc" in the column's name with "Accelerometer".
  ## names(TidyData) <-gsub("Gyro", "Gyroscope", names(TidyData)): This replaces all "Gyro" in the column's name with "Gyroscope".
  ## names(TidyData)<-gsub("BodyBody", "Body", names(TidyData)): This replaces all "BodyBody" in the column's name with "Body".
  ## names(TidyData)<-gsub("Mag", "Magnitude", names(TidyData)): This replaces all "Mag" in the column's name with "Magnitude".
  ## names(TidyData)<-gsub("^t", "Time", names(TidyData)): This replaces the string starting with "^t" in the column's name with "Time".
  ## names(TidyData)<-gsub("^f", "Frequency", names(TidyData)): This replaces the string starting with "^f" in the column's name with "Frequency".
  ## names(TidyData)<-gsub("tBody", "TimeBody", names(TidyData)): This replaces all "tBody" in the column's name with "TimeBody".
  ## names(TidyData)<-gsub("-mean()", "Mean", names(TidyData), ignore.case = TRUE): This replaces all "-mean()" in the column's name with "Mean".
  ## names(TidyData)<-gsub("-std()", "STD", names(TidyData), ignore.case = TRUE): This replaces all "-std()" in the column's name with "STD".
  ## names(TidyData)<-gsub("-freq()", "Frequency", names(TidyData), ignore.case = TRUE): This replaces all "-freq()" in the column's name with "Frequency".
  ## names(TidyData)<-gsub("angle", "Angle", names(TidyData)): This replaces all "angle" in the column's name with "Angle".
  ## names(TidyData)<-gsub("gravity", "Gravity", names(TidyData)): This replaces all "gravity" in the column's name with "Gravity".

# Step 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  ## Final_Data <- TidyData %>% group_by(subject, activity) %>% summarize_all(funs(mean)):
     It is made by sumarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
     after groupped by subject and activity. 
  ## write.table(Final_Data, "Final_Data.txt", row.name = FALSE): Export Fanal_Data into Final_Data.txt file.
